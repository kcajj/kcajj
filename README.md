My name is Giacomo, I am a bachelor student in [Genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics) at University of Bologna.

I love to spend my time solving problems and learning things. I participated to a research project in the group of [Richard Neher](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/research-groups-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-richard-neher) in Biozentrum, the work can be found in the following repositories: [West Nile Virus](https://github.com/kcajj/west_nile_virus), [evolution analysis of phages](https://github.com/kcajj/ONT_phages), [recombination analysis of phages](https://github.com/kcajj/rec_genome_analysis)
