My name is Giacomo, I am studying Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at ETH Zurich.

I graduated in [Genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics) at University of Bologna in summer 2024.

I love to spend my time solving problems and learning things. I participated to a research project in the group of [Richard Neher](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/research-groups-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-richard-neher) in Biozentrum during the Biozentrum research summer program 2023. I developed a pipeline for the analysis of recombinant phage population arising from directed evolution experiments. I got so passionate about this project that I decided to write my bachelor thesis on it, you can fine everything [here](https://github.com/kcajj/recombinant_population_analysis).
